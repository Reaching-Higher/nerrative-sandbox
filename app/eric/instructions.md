# WF Component Build! #

Your task here is to code out a version of the wireframe included in this folder.

> Instructions:
- Use flexbox to manage the position of your component in the layout.
- Use CSS grid to build the internal layout. Each internal element is up to you.
- Use proper semantic html where applicable.
- Use the prebuilt tailwind classes for colors and text elements. These can be found in the tailwind.config.js file in the root directory.
- As depicted in the wireframe, all actionable elements should respond to hover.

> Notes:
- You do not have to use typescript in this round. We'll go through that phase on the second pass.
- You do not need to make this responsive, desktop view is fine for now.
- Notice that the current layout has a dark background - you will need to adapt the colors in the WF so that they are appropriate for dark mode.
- The sizes of each element don't need to be pixel perfect, but try to keep a similar alignment between the elements.
